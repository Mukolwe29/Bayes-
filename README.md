# Bayesian Inference Notebook

This repository contains a detailed explanation and calculations for Bayesian inference in the context of medical testing and genetic conditions.

## Contents

- **Bayesian_Inference.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that explains the problem and provides mathematical derivations for posterior probabilities.
- **Bayesian_Inference.md**: A Markdown version of the notebook for easy viewing.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Problem Overview

The notebook addresses the following problems:

1. **Posterior Probability with Conditionally Independent Test Results**:
   - Derives the posterior probability of having a disease given multiple positive test results, assuming conditional independence.

2. **Posterior Probability with Genetic Condition**:
   - Extends the analysis to include the possibility of a genetic condition that always results in positive test results.

3. **Posterior Probability of Having the Gene**:
   - Calculates the posterior probability of having the gene given multiple positive test results.
